# w10-final-project

Adding this README file. To be updated once the final project takes final shape, but below is an initial description of what I plan to do for this project.

I will be setting up a simple order management system as a Flask web app.

Pages:
- Order page
-   Choose between round containers or slim containers
-   Input quantity
-   Show price per unit and total price for given quantity
-   Select if for pickup or for delivery
-   If for delivery, request for address and add option to schedule delivery or deliver immediately
- Log in page (Admin login only)
- Manage orders (Only if logged in as admin)
-   View list of current orders with order details from Order page
-   Present order status (e.g. open, for pickup / delivery, delivery in progress, cancelled, completed) including timestamp for each status change
-   Record sales
- Order history page
-   Present order history including latest status
- Sales page
-   Present summary of sales, with option to filter by date
